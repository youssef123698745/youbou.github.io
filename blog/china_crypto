The State of China continues its fierce campaign against digital currencies. It began a while ago to restrict dealing with digital currencies, especially bitcoin, and then banned mining, although China was the first in this activity, and this time the Chinese Central Bank announced on Friday that all financial transactions involving illegal cryptocurrencies.


According to Reuters news agency, 10 Chinese government agencies, including the central bank as well as banks, securities and foreign exchange regulators, said in a joint statement that they will work closely to maintain "high pressure" on cryptocurrency trading. The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, said cryptocurrencies should not be traded in the markets as traditional currencies and that offshore exchanges are prohibited from providing services to mainland investors online.


Reuters said the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has also banned financial institutions, payment companies and internet companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trading. The People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website that the Chinese government will "resolutely enforce restrictions on virtual currency speculation, related financial activities and misconduct in order to protect people's property and maintain economic, financial and social order."


Reuters noted that the new Chinese move affected global markets, so that the bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, fell more than 6% to $42,267, after falling earlier by about 1%. Smaller currencies, which usually rise and fall along with bitcoin, also fell. Ether is down 10% while XRP is down by a similar amount.
