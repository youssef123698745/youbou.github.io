A while ago, the famous Finnish company Nokia returned to the market through the Finnish company HMD Global as well, which is responsible for the manufacture of its devices, and during the last period it presented many distinctive phones, but Nokia's ambition seems to want to expand the range of its devices and not be limited to smartphones only.


And the official page of Nokia on the social networking site Twitter published a teaser image showing a number of famous and distinguished Nokia phones, and at the far end of the picture it is possible to notice a larger box in white, with reference to the date of the sixth of next October, which seems to be a suspense By the Finnish company for a new device, and all the specialized sites have agreed that it is a new tablet computer for Nokia..

SlashGear said that rumors about this Nokia-branded tablet surfaced a few months ago. The tablet is purportedly called the Nokia T20, and is believed to have a 10.36-inch screen, 4GB of RAM and a Unisoc processor. There will only be 64GB of expandable storage, and network connectivity only supports Wi-Fi and 4G, but those specs are not impressive for a company of Nokia's size.


Despite that, the lack of accurate information so far will force us to wait until the sixth of October to know the full specifications of the device.
