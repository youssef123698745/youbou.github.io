Netflix has released a free virtual reality game called Eden Unearthed for Oculus Quest devices. The game is available through the App Lab, not the Oculus Store, which means that this game hasn't gone through the full Oculus review process and could be beta or still in development.

According to the specialized website Game World Observer, the title of the new virtual reality game is a video game link to the Netflix animated series Eden. Set in a world inhabited only by robots, the title doesn't offer much content other than riding a futuristic motorbike while collecting fuel and unlocking small portions of the combo. . It is only available through the App Lab, and cannot be found unless users are given the link or search for it by its exact name.

Netflix targeting Oculus shouldn't come as a complete surprise. After all, Mike Verdo, the newly appointed Vice President of Game Development at Netflix, is Oculus' Vice President of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Content.
